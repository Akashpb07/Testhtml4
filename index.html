        <p>Hi, As a member of the age group that grew up with access to the internet, I am in a unique position in our non-profit organization since the CEO has given me the responsibility of leading the development of a website and blog. The confidence in my skills, which I have developed via classes like Comp101, inspires me to work hard on this project even though I am not an expert in digital platforms. Since we don't have the funds to hire an expensive consultant, I'm determined to use my experience and abilities to help our organization achieve its goals of growing its membership and improving public relations. Accepting this challenge, I'm ready to set out on an innovative and exploratory path that will lead our firm to success in the digital sphere.</p>
